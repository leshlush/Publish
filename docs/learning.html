			<h2>Learning Web Design</h2>
			<p>I've taken up a new hobby: learning web design.
			I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the three languages used to build web pages. I've created several
			web pages that stylish and interactive.</p>
			<p>Until now, I've been making single web pages in 
			JSitor. Starting today, I want to learn how to make
			multi-page websites. I'm editing my code offline
			in the Sublime text editor. It's a lot to learn, but I'm very happy with how it's going so far.</p>
