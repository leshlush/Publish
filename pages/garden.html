			<h2>My New Garden</h2>
			<p>In addition to web design, I've been learning two new hobbies: gardening,
				and photography. It's been a lot of fun.</p>
			<p>I thought I'd make a new blog post to show off what I've been doing.</p>

			<img id="corners" src="../images/one.jpg" alt="image not found">
			<p>These were the first flowers I planted, and I love how they look.</p>
			
			<img id="round" src="../images/two.jpg" alt="image not found">
			<p>I picked some flowers to practice arranging, and decided to practice
			photography, too. I thought this picture looked great cropped in a circle.</p>

			<p>I didn't plant these cherry trees, but I love how they look! I make get this photo framed.</p>

			<p>If you pick up gardening as a hobby, you can't be afraid to get your hands dirty!</p>
