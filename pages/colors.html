			<h2>Color Theory</h2>
			<p>I want to make my web pages look more stylish, so I've been learning more about color theory.
			I've started learning basic facts, like the difference between warm colors and cool colors,
			and what makes two colors complementary. I've spent a lot of time looking at the color wheel.</p>
			<p>Of course, to really learn about color theory, I'll need more practice.  That's why I plan to
			implement the ideas I've been learning about by creating new web pages with different color styles.</p>
			<p>Check back for updates! I'll make sure to link my new creations here on the blog.</p>
